metamake Theory of Operation

Python is a nice config language - easy to read, easy to modify, clear
and unambiguous syntax.

make is ominpresent, fast, reliable and arcane.

Making software is a huge pain and every project uses a different
blend of tools that subtley conflict with each other. The goal of
metamake is to easily federate across this twisted space.

Dependencies and transformations are specified in Python. They are
then reduced to a makefile for parallel execution and dependecy
analysis. When a better dependency and execution engine comes along,
migration is just a python script away.
